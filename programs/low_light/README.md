Low light
=========

A program that features a low-output mode. For that moments when you need to
read a piece of paper in the dark, but don't want to be completely blind for
the next minute because the Hexbright is too damn bright.

Modes:
------

* Low: Keep the button pressed, release to turn off
* Normal: Click to turn on, click to turn off
* High: In Normal mode, keep the button pressed

Battery status:
---------------
When turned on, the red LED will blink for half a second every 15 seconds if
the battery is running low.
During charging the green LED will blink and change to perma-on when fully
charged.
